        <p>
            Hi, I’m Harsh Raj, a BTech First year student at IIIT Kalyani(2024-28), passionate about technology, creativity, and leadership. My journey has been defined by determination and growth, and I’m constantly exploring new ways to push my boundaries.

            I’m also a proud member of the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) club, where I contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with like-minded peers to solve real-world problems. My current interests lie in web development and ethical hacking skills that allow me to combine logic with creativity.
            When I’m not coding or exploring technology, I enjoy playing Hockey, listening to music. In 2019 I was selected as a National Player in Hockey.

            Recently, I was honored to be selected for the Reliance Scholarship 2025, standing among the top 5,000 scholars chosen from over 1 lakh applicants nationwide. This recognition reflects my dedication to academic excellence and my ambition to contribute meaningfully to the tech world.

            Let’s connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshraj112/" style="color: wheat; font-family: cursive;">LinkedIn</a> and create something impactful together!
